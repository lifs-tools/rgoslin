Description: The R implementation for the Grammar of Succint Lipid Nomenclature
    parses different short hand notation dialects for lipid names. It 
    normalizes them to a standard name. It further provides calculated 
    monoisotopic masses and sum formulas for each successfully parsed lipid name and supplements it with LIPID MAPS
    Category and Class information. Also, the structural level and further structural
    details about the head group, fatty acyls and functional groups are returned, where applicable.
